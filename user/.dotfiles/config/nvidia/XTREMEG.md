- ✅ Check if GPU is supported by this XtremeG version

**Problem:** Black screen after installation
- ✅ Boot into Safe Mode
- ✅ Run DDU and install official driver
- ✅ May need to enable Secure Boot again

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Lower performance than expected
- ✅ Verify GPU clocks with GPU-Z or MSI Afterburner
- ✅ Check power management mode in NVIDIA Control Panel
- ✅ Apply additional tweaks from `nvidia-performance-tweaks.reg`

**Problem:** Games crashing
- ✅ May need to apply stability tweaks (enable preemption)
- ✅ Check if game-specific profile is needed

## Reverting to Official Drivers

If you have issues:

1. **Boot into Safe Mode**
2. **Run DDU** → Clean NVIDIA drivers
3. **Reboot**
4. **Download official driver** from [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)
5. **Install official driver**
6. **Re-enable Secure Boot** in BIOS if you disabled it

## Additional Optimizations

After installing XtremeG drivers, you can apply additional tweaks:

### Recommended (Safe):
```cmd
# Apply our consolidated performance tweaks
regedit /s nvidia-performance-tweaks.reg

# Disable MPO if you have flickering
regedit /s toggles/disable-mpo.reg

# Enable hardware scheduling
regedit /s toggles/enable-hardware-scheduling.reg
```

### Check What's Already Applied:
XtremeG drivers may already include some tweaks. Use the PowerShell script to check:
```powershell
cd ~/Scripts
.\gpu-display-manager.ps1
# Choose "View Current Settings" to see what's configured
```

## FAQ

**Q: Are XtremeG drivers safe?**
A: They're modified by a community developer, not NVIDIA. Use at your own risk. Many users report no issues, but there's always risk with unofficial software.

**Q: Will I get banned in games?**
A: Unlikely. These are modified drivers, not game cheats. However, always check game-specific anti-cheat policies.

**Q: Can I update through GeForce Experience?**
A: No, GFE is removed. You must manually download new XtremeG versions.

**Q: Do I lose DLSS/Ray Tracing?**
A: No, RTX features are retained.

**Q: How often are XtremeG drivers updated?**
A: Depends on the creator. Check r/XtremeG regularly. Usually follows major NVIDIA releases.

**Q: Can I use NVIDIA Profile Inspector?**
A: Yes, NVIDIA Profile Inspector works normally with XtremeG drivers.

**Q: What about driver signature enforcement?**
A: XtremeG drivers are usually signed, but you may need to:
- Disable Secure Boot in BIOS
- Enable test signing mode (usually not required)

**Q: Are there other alternatives?**
A: Yes:
- **NVCleanstall** - Tool to customize official drivers during install
- **Official drivers + manual debloat** - Use our `nvidia-telemetry-cleanup.bat`
- **Studio drivers** - More stable, less frequent updates

## Security Considerations

### Risks:
- ⚠️ Modified drivers could theoretically contain malware
- ⚠️ Reduced driver signature validation
- ⚠️ No official support channel
- ⚠️ Dependency on third-party hosting (MEGA.nz)

### Mitigations:
- ✅ Download only from trusted sources (official XtremeG posts)
- ✅ Scan downloads with antivirus
- ✅ Check community feedback before installing
- ✅ Use virtual machine for testing first (if paranoid)
- ✅ Create system restore point before installation

## Alternatives to XtremeG

If you want optimization without custom drivers:

### Option 1: Official + Manual Debloat
```cmd
# Install official NVIDIA driver
# Then run our telemetry cleanup
nvidia-telemetry-cleanup.bat

# Apply performance tweaks
regedit /s nvidia-performance-tweaks.reg
```

### Option 2: NVCleanstall (Recommended for most users)
- [NVCleanstall](https://www.techpowerup.com/nvcleanstall/)
- GUI tool to customize official drivers
- Remove telemetry/bloat during installation
- Safer than pre-modified drivers

### Option 3: Manual Driver Extraction
See our README.md for manual driver debloat instructions.
